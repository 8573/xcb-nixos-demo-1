Someone in the IRC channel <ircs://chat.freenode.net/nixos> (#nixos on
freenode) was asking for help building some Rust code using the Rust library
`xcb` (<https://crates.io/crates/xcb>), so I built this repository around
their code as an example of what I think is a good way to build Rust projects
on NixOS.

Their code didn't actually work, so I then replaced it with an example from
the `xcb` library's repository.

I release this repository under the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain
dedication, except for the file `src/main.rs`, which is copied from
<https://github.com/rtbo/rust-xcb> and under the MIT licence.
